### Using this Discord Bot
- Message adsfasdf to invite picture-police to your server.

# Usage

1. Member in server sends an image.
2. The bot will instantly pull the image from the chat and analyze the image for inappropriate material (profanity, nudity, etc.)
3. If the image is completely safe, no changes! Otherwise, the NSFW sections will be covered by some kittens.

# Examples
